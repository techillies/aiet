							This great institution is founded on the noble principle "No religion is greater than Service" With a firm belief that "Service to Humanity is Service to God" and this is the Kayaka Dasoha Philosophy.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							In the present scenario, our country needs education, which should enable the students to read, write, understand, think independently; face the challenges of life and work hard sincerely. It should also create job opportunities. After getting education, the students should help in running their families and also contribute their best to the welfare of the society and the country. If they do it honestly, that itself is Kayaka Dasoha Philosophy of Education.
							<br/>
							<br/>

							The Sharnbasweshwar Vidya Vardhak Sangha, Gulbarga, which was founded in the year 1903, is named after the great mystic Saint of Deccan India, Lord Sharnbasweshwar. It is the cardinal principle of Sharnbasweshwar that "No religion is greater than Service" and "Service to Humanity is Service to God". This Kayaka and Dasoha Philosophy is his legacy, which is continued even today by the Peethadhipathis of Sharnbasweshwar Samsthan.
							<br/>
							<br/>

							The Sharnbasaweshwar Samsthan, which is also called as Sharnbasweshwar Mahadasohapeetha has a long spiritual, cultural, social and educational history that represents the glorious heritage of the nation. The Philosophy of Dasoha has been the touchstone principle on which the 7th Mahadasoha Peethadhipathi of Sharnbasweshwar Samsthan, Gulbarga, founded the Sharnbasweshwar Vidya Vardhak Sangha. The first school of our Sangha was housed in the Dasoha Mahamane (The Spiritual Abode), where Lord Sharnbasweshwar resided.
